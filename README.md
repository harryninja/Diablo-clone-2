# Diablo-Clone

# What is it?
  It's a 3D prototype of Diablo made in Unity 2019.1.11f. This project was an attempt for me to practice my Unity skills
  and learn more about various features of the game engine, such as navmeshing, blend trees, state machines, and so on
  
# Whats in it?
  The project contains two scenes that illustrate the various features I have implemented thus far in the prototype. 
  
  ## Features
  - Point-and-click movement system using Unity's Navmeshing (For both enemies and players)
  - Save and load system using serialization and dictionaries
  - Thorough Enemy AI (Enemies have a vision radius, chase after player, and search for player at last known location)
  - Equipment and Item System (different types of weapons, such as swords, rapiers, bows, magic)
  - Diablo/Path of Exile type camera system that I implemented from scratch 
  - Awesome low-poly assets provided courtesty of Synty
  - Character Progression (Leveling System, Character Stats) -- ToDo
